# Research Brief: Organizational Context as Signal for Threat Intelligence Relevance

**Adversarix Research · July 2026 · Status: Internal brief — pre-publication**

---

## 1. Motivation

Every threat intelligence product claims to deliver "relevant" intel, and nearly all of them operationalize relevance the same way: match the intel's industry-sector and geography tags against the customer's profile. Whether those attributes actually predict that a given piece of intel matters to a given organization is a question the industry has largely assumed rather than tested.

This brief summarizes a structured, source-verified literature review (July 2026) on which organizational context attributes carry real, evidence-backed signal for CTI relevance, and translates the findings into a prioritized research and engineering agenda for the AEGIS relevance-scoring layer.

**Scope.** Given a piece of threat intel — actor report, campaign, CVE, IOC set, TTP — which facts about an organization (tech stack, attack surface, sector, geography, size, supply chain, data types, detection coverage, incident history) predict whether that intel matters to it?

**Method note.** Findings below were produced by a multi-agent research pipeline: five parallel search angles (frameworks/standards, vulnerability decision systems, empirical victimology, vendor implementations, critiques), 23 sources fetched, 113 claims extracted, top 25 adversarially verified by independent 3-vote panels (23 confirmed, 2 refuted). Verification votes and caveats are carried inline.

## 2. What the evidence supports: a hierarchy of relevance signals

### 2.1 Strongest signal: asset / tech-stack presence

The best-supported organizational relevance filter is simply whether the affected technology exists in the environment, and the base rates make it enormously powerful:

- Only **~44% of CVEs** (published 2016–2018) were ever detected open in *any* corporate environment, across hundreds of enterprises (Kenna data, foundational EPSS paper [1]).
- Only **~3.7% of CVEs** (921 of 25,159) were observed exploited in the wild within 12 months of disclosure [1]. Later estimates place this at ~5–6%; the qualitative conclusion is durable.

*Caveats:* 3.7% is a lower bound (IDS/honeypot signature-coverage bias); the 44% figure conflates asset absence with scanner-signature gaps, so 56%-never-observed is an upper bound on the pure asset-absence effect. (Verified 3-0, 3-0.)

### 2.2 Most predictive power: exploitation-ecosystem attributes

The best-validated predictors of exploitation are vulnerability-intrinsic and ecosystem attributes — **not** organizational attributes: vendor identity, published/weaponized exploit code, vulnerability tags (remote code execution), CVE reference counts. Weaponized PoC code raises observed exploitation from the 3.7% base rate to **37.1%** — a ~10x lift [1] (N=283; corroborated by Suciu et al. and EPSS v3). (Verified 3-0.)

### 2.3 Weak / unvalidated: sector, geography, company size

- **No surviving empirical evidence** in the review tests whether sector or geography independently predict firm-level victimization after controlling for tech stack and attack surface. The frameworks and products that use them *assume* rather than validate them.
- **IBM's patented affectedness engine** (US11194905) uses sector+geography as its only org-profile attributes — but only to *scope* sighting queries. Its core mechanism is empirical sighting frequency, and **first-party observation in the customer's own telemetry receives the single largest default weight (35%, vs. 25% for industry/geo-similar sightings)** [6]. Even a sector-based product ranks direct observation above profile similarity. Note the 35/25 split is an unfitted heuristic, and a patent describes a design, not verified deployed behavior. (Verified 3-0, 3-0, 2-1.)
- **CISA's operational SSVC tree** uses exactly five decision attributes — exploitation status, technical impact, automatability, mission prevalence, public well-being — and **deliberately excludes sector, geography, and company size** [5]. (Verified 3-0.)
- The **one direct empirical test** of org-attribute relevance scoring (McCoy et al. 2024 [2]): joining sector + country + CPE-normalized software inventory to ATT&CK actor-targeting data improved vulnerability ranking **71.5–91.3% over CVSS-only** (23–25% annualized cost savings) across six universities and four government proxy organizations. *Treat as promising, not settled:* the headline claim drew a 2-1 verification vote — weak CVSS-only baseline, partially circular ground truth (exploitation-in-the-wild shared with policy criteria), synthetic government inventories, unreplicated.

### 2.4 Folklore: severity thresholds and single-score inheritance

- **CVSS 7+ remediation yields 6.2% precision**; EPSS achieves equivalent coverage with 28.8–85.9% less remediation effort (AUC 0.838). CVSS base scores contain no data element enumerating a specific threat to an organization — still true in CVSS v4.0, where Exploit Maturity sits in the separate Threat metric group [1][2]. (Verified 3-0.)
- **The four major scoring systems agree at chance level.** CVSS, EPSS, SSVC, and Microsoft Exploitability Index on the same 600 Patch Tuesday CVEs: Cohen's Kappa −0.01 to 0.03 across all pairs, Krippendorff's Alpha predominantly negative (Koscinski et al., ACM CCS 2025 [7]). Partly by design (different constructs), but perceived priority depends mostly on which system was adopted. (Verified 3-0.)
- **KEV membership is a coarse proxy:** only ~32% of KEV entries (483 of 1,488 as of 2026-01-14) are immediately exploitable for initial access (unauthenticated RCE, no user interaction); the lowest-scoring KEV entries have EPSS below 0.001 [8]. Single-vendor snapshot — date-stamp when citing. (Verified 3-0.)

### 2.5 Doctrine: relevance is decision-anchored and dynamic

FIRST's PIR curriculum [3] and SSVC [5] converge on the same design stance: relevance is anchored to a **bounded set of stakeholder decisions** and deployment context, not static attribute matching — and it is **perishable**: "PIRs are fluid and not static. When an operational environment changes, the PIRs and everything the PIRs support or are supported by, must be re-evaluated." CTI-CMM [4] makes crown-jewel asset inventory the core org attribute and reserves org-specific exploitation probability for its top maturity tier (CTI3) — asserting it as the goal without providing a way to measure it. (All verified 3-0; these are normative expert consensus, not empirical measurement.)

## 3. Implications for AEGIS

The evidence points to investing where signal is proven but implementations are crude, and treating popular-but-unvalidated signals as research questions rather than product features.

### Tier 1 — Asset presence as the gating filter

The strongest-evidenced signal is exactly what the Threat Knowledge Graph already models, and AEGIS's live topology is a structural advantage over scanner-based, point-in-time approaches. Priority engineering work: rigorous entity resolution between intel artifacts and the graph — CPE/package normalization, version-range matching, resolving vendor advisories to deployed assets. This filter alone discards the majority of vulnerability-flavored intel with high confidence and shrinks the denominator for every downstream score.

### Tier 2 — Exploitation-ecosystem fusion, never single-score inheritance

Ingest EPSS, KEV, PoC weaponization, and observed-exploitation signals as **features into AEGIS's own model**; never inherit any one as the ranking (chance-level inter-system agreement makes that indefensible). Condition KEV/exploitability on topology position — internet-facing vs. internal — which the graph enables and flat scoring systems cannot do.

### Tier 3 — Two AEGIS-native signals (novel, defensible, publishable)

1. **Simulation-derived relevance.** Define relevance as *the change a piece of intel induces in simulated attack-path success probability for this specific environment*, computed via the existing Monte Carlo pipeline. This operationalizes CTI-CMM's top-maturity signal ("probability of exploitation against the enterprise") — which the framework asserts but no one measures — and extends the polymorphic-attack-chains work: intel enabling a new variant chain is relevant even when the direct path is blocked.
2. **Empirically fitted first-party sighting weights.** The IBM patent ranks first-party observation above profile similarity but with unfitted heuristic weights. AEGIS's detection-gap analysis already observes the environment; fitting sighting-vs-similarity weights against real outcomes (advisory accept/dismiss, subsequent detections) is both a product improvement and a paper.

### Deprioritize — sector/geography as scoring inputs

Use sector and geography only as a coarse prior for actor-targeting overlap (per the McCoy result, with its caveats), with no independent weight in the score. Instead, make validation the flagship research question (§4, Q1).

### Design constraints to bake in now

- **Drift triggers, not cadence.** Wire re-scoring to graph-change events (new asset class, decommission, M&A-scale topology shifts) rather than timers — implementing FIRST doctrine natively in an autonomous platform.
- **Pick ground truth before building the model.** Avoid the McCoy circularity trap (scoring features shared with ground-truth definitions). The cleanest label stream AEGIS has is org-specific: analyst accept/dismiss decisions on advisories plus subsequent detection/incident outcomes — not population-level exploitation, which is what everyone else trains on and why their scores disagree at chance level.

## 4. Open research questions

1. **Does sector or geography carry independent predictive signal for firm-level victimization after controlling for tech stack and external attack surface — or are they merely coarse correlates?** No DBIR-style victimology or firm-level breach-prediction evidence survived verification; the frameworks that use these attributes assume them. AEGIS's cross-customer graph data is positioned to answer this, and either outcome is publishable.
2. **What re-evaluation triggers operationalize relevance drift?** Which environment-change events (M&A, new products, cloud migrations) invalidate prior relevance judgments, and at what magnitude?
3. **Can org-specific exploitation probability be measured rather than asserted** — by combining first-party telemetry sightings with attack-surface and simulation data — and how should first-party observation be weighted against profile similarity when fitted, not defaulted?
4. **What ground truth should a knowledge-graph relevance layer train and evaluate against** — population-level exploitation, org-specific incident/detection outcomes, or analyst decision quality — and how is feature/label circularity avoided?

## 5. Refuted claims — do not cite

Two claims encountered during the review were refuted (0-3) under adversarial verification:

1. ~~CTI-CMM prescribes a continuously updated organizational threat profile whose axes are threat actor groups, tools, and TTPs filtered by sector and geography.~~ (Not supported by CTI-CMM v1.3 text.)
2. ~~Fewer than 20% of KEV CVEs had an EPSS score above 0.5 before KEV addition.~~ (Not supported by the cited source.)

**Evidence-type caveat.** Framework claims (§2.5) are normative expert consensus, not empirical validation. The strongest empirical results concern vulnerability-flavored intel with population-level exploitation as ground truth — a proxy, not org-specific victimization. The empirical case for sector/geography/size as independent predictors remains essentially untested.
