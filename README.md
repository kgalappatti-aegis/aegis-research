# Adversarix Research

Public research publications from [Adversarix](https://adversarix.com), an autonomous
threat intelligence and response platform built around a live Threat Knowledge Graph.

Adversarix continuously ingests threat intelligence, simulates adversarial behavior
against an organization's real infrastructure topology, identifies detection gaps, and
synthesizes prioritized advisories without waiting for human initiation. These papers
document the methods behind that platform (the simulation models, the measurement
frameworks, and the threat-modeling approaches) for public reference and citation.

### Defending Against Polymorphic Attack Chains: How Autonomous Adversarial Simulation Closes the Detection Gap
**April 2026 · Version 2.0**

[→ Download PDF](./polymorphic-attack-chains/Adversarix_Polymorphic_Attack_Chains_Whitepaper.pdf)

Modern threat actors don't follow a single kill chain. They maintain technique
repertoires and rotate between them in response to what your detection stack catches.
This paper examines how the Adversarix platform addresses polymorphic attack chains
through a six-agent autonomous pipeline built on a live Threat Knowledge Graph, running
five distinct adversarial simulation strategies and Monte Carlo probability modeling to
characterize the full adversarial option space, not just a single representative path. It
also details the platform's procedure-level fidelity (sub-technique execution modules
parameterized to named-actor procedures) and walks an end-to-end critical-CVE response
from disclosure to advisory in under 90 seconds.

**Key findings:**
- Reduced mean time from threat indicator ingestion to actionable advisory from 4–8 analyst hours to under 90 seconds
- Increased simulated attack path coverage by more than 300% vs. manual simulation workflows
- A critical RCE CVE on a perimeter mail server raised Monte Carlo campaign success probability by 34% across all polymorphic kill chain variants
- Procedure-intelligence extraction validated at F1 > 0.89 on structured incident-response reports, grounding simulation at sub-technique granularity

**Topics:** polymorphic kill chain taxonomy · five-strategy simulation framework · Monte Carlo probability modeling · procedure-level fidelity & actor emulation · detection gap analysis · human-in-the-loop governance

### Agentic Identity Pivots: Modeling Credential-Borne Lateral Movement in Breach Simulation
**July 2026 · Version 1.0**

[→ Download PDF](./agentic-identity-pivots/Adversarix_Agentic_Identity_Pivots_Whitepaper.pdf)

As enterprise estates go agentic, with autonomous agents holding credentials, invoking tools,
and reaching capability through MCP servers, shared-credential pivots become the dominant
lateral-movement surface. Most threat models represent credential abuse only as a technique
label, which cannot express how far a compromise actually spreads. This paper describes how
Adversarix adds an agent–credential–tool topology to the Threat Knowledge Graph and makes
the Monte Carlo breach simulation *traverse* it, so agentic lateral movement becomes a real,
quantified term in breach probability.

**Key findings:**
- Pivot-success probability is governed by credential *posture*, not technique label: a static shared key scores 0.90, a delegation-attenuated token 0.20, a 4.5× spread a technique-only model collapses
- A unified heterogeneous walk lets a single attack path interleave technique steps and credential pivots, with detection applied to pivots via the technique they realize
- A structural regression lock guarantees the model is purely additive: estates with no identity topology reproduce the prior breach probability exactly

**Topics:** agentic AI threat modeling · credential posture priors · MCP/tool reachability · heterogeneous graph traversal · bounded path explosion · regression-locked risk scoring

### Measuring TTP Extraction: A Reproducible Evaluation Framework for ATT&CK Technique Extraction from Threat Reports
**July 2026 · Version 1.0**

[→ Download PDF](./ttp-extraction-eval/Adversarix_TTP_Extraction_Eval_Whitepaper.pdf)

Extracting MITRE ATT&CK techniques from unstructured threat reporting is a core pipeline
primitive, and notoriously hard to measure well. This paper describes an evaluation
framework built to be reproducible and honest: ground truth auto-derived from public CISA
advisory tables (zero manual annotation), partial credit for parent–child technique matches,
a substantiation split for the text-only ceiling, and F1 reported as a range across
non-deterministic runs. Accuracy is measured at both the document and sentence level across
three corpora of different provenance.

**Key findings:**
- F1 of 0.84–0.92 on 163 auto-derived ground-truth techniques with precision 0.92–0.94, so the extractor rarely hallucinates technique IDs
- Parent-match partial credit resolves a systematic cross-corpus granularity mismatch that exact-match scoring double-penalizes
- A near-zero threat-model coverage delta is reported as a genuine result: ~84% of cited techniques are already present from actor- and campaign-level signals

**Topics:** ATT&CK technique extraction · zero-annotation corpus construction · parent–child partial-credit scoring · TRAM & AnnoCTR sentence-level benchmarks · non-determinism and multi-run evaluation · downstream coverage measurement

### Empirical Detection Posteriors: Closing the Loop from SIEM Firings to Breach Probability
**July 2026 · Version 1.0**

[→ Download PDF](./detection-posteriors/Adversarix_Empirical_Detection_Posteriors_Whitepaper.pdf)

Breach simulations usually model detection as an assumption: a technique is "covered" if a
rule exists for it. But a deployed rule that never fires is not coverage. This paper describes
how Adversarix feeds production SIEM telemetry back into the Monte Carlo breach simulation as a
per-technique *empirical detection posterior*: a Beta distribution fit to real firing evidence
that replaces a global detection constant, raising breach probability where coverage is illusory
and lowering it where rules fire cleanly.

**Key findings:**
- A "deployed-blind" technique (rule present but required log source missing, so it cannot fire) is driven *below* the neutral prior, correcting illusory coverage
- Detection *uncertainty* propagates: the simulation samples the posterior per iteration, so a technique with three firings is treated as less certain than one with three thousand
- A byte-identical fallback guarantees organizations without SIEM telemetry see no change in breach probability, so the mechanism is purely additive

**Topics:** empirical Bayesian detection modeling · SIEM firing telemetry · Beta posterior fitting with count down-weighting · uncertainty propagation in Monte Carlo simulation · detection-posture feedback loops · regression-locked risk scoring
